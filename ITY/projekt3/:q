[1mNAME[0m
       [1mncurses [22m- character-cell terminal interface with optimized output

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <ncursesw/curses.h>[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  ‚Äúnew  curses‚Äù  library  offers the programmer a terminal-independent means of reading keyboard and mouse input and writing to character-cell displays with output optimized to minimize screen updates.
       [4mncurses[24m replaces the [4mcurses[24m libraries from System V Release 4 Unix (‚ÄúSVr4‚Äù) and 4.4BSD Unix, the development of which ceased in the 1990s.  This document describes [4mncurses[24m version 6.5 (patch 20250308).

       [4mncurses[24m permits control of the terminal screen's contents; abstraction and subdivision thereof with [4mwindows[24m and [4mpads[24m; acquisition of keyboard and mouse events; selection of color and rendering  attributes
       (such  as  bold or underline); the definition and use of [4msoft[24m [4mlabel[24m keys; access to the [4mterminfo[24m terminal capability database; a [4mtermcap[24m compatibility interface; and an abstraction of the system's API for
       manipulating the terminal (such as [4mtermios[24m(3)).

       [4mncurses[24m implements the interface described by X/Open Curses Issue 7.  In many behavioral details not standardized by X/Open, [4mncurses[24m emulates the [4mcurses[24m library of SVr4 and provides numerous useful exten‚Äê
       sions.

       [4mncurses[24m man pages employ several sections to clarify matters of usage and interoperability with other [4mcurses[24m implementations.

       ‚Ä¢   ‚ÄúNOTES‚Äù describes issues and caveats of which any user of the [4mncurses[24m API should be aware, such as limitations on the size of an underlying integral type or the availability of  a  preprocessor  macro
           exclusive of a function definition (which prevents its address from being taken).  This section also describes implementation details of significance to the programmer but which are not standardized.

       ‚Ä¢   ‚ÄúEXTENSIONS‚Äù presents [4mncurses[24m innovations beyond the X/Open Curses standard and/or the SVr4 [4mcurses[24m implementation.  They are termed [4mextensions[24m to indicate that they cannot be implemented solely by us‚Äê
           ing the library API, but require access to the library's internal state.

       ‚Ä¢   ‚ÄúPORTABILITY‚Äù discusses matters (beyond the exercise of extensions) that should be considered when writing to a [4mcurses[24m standard, or for multiple implementations.

       ‚Ä¢   ‚ÄúHISTORY‚Äù  examines points of detail in [4mncurses[24m and other [4mcurses[24m implementations over the decades of their development, particularly where precedent or inertia have frustrated better design (and, in a
           few cases, where such inertia has been overcome).

       A [4mcurses[24m application must be linked with the library; use the [1m-lncurses [22moption to your compiler or linker.  A debugging version of the library may be available; if so,  link  with  it  using  [1m-lncurses_g[22m.
       (Your system integrator may have installed these libraries such that you can use the options [1m-lcurses [22mand [1m-lcurses_g[22m, respectively.)  The [4mncurses_g[24m library logs events describing [4mncurses[24m actions to a file
       called [4mtrace[24m in the current directory.  See section ‚ÄúALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS‚Äù below.

   [1mApplication Structure[0m
       A [4mcurses[24m application uses information from the system locale; [4msetlocale[24m(3) prepares it for [4mcurses[24m library calls.

           setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

       If the locale is not thus initialized, the library assumes that characters are printable as in ISO 8859-1, to work with certain legacy programs.  You should initialize the locale; do not expect consistent
       behavior from the library when the locale has not been set up.

       [1minitscr[22m(3NCURSES) or [1mnewterm[22m(3NCURSES) must be called to initialize [4mcurses[24m before use of any functions that access or manipulate windows or screens.

       To get character-at-a-time input without echoing‚Äîmost interactive, screen-oriented programs want this‚Äîuse the following sequence.

           initscr(); cbreak(); noecho();

       Most applications would perform further setup as follows.

           noqiflush();
           keypad(stdscr, TRUE);

       A [4mcurses[24m program then often enters an event loop of some sort.  Call [1mendwin[22m(3NCURSES) before exiting.

   [1mOverview[0m
       A [4mcurses[24m library abstracts the terminal with a [4mSCREEN[24m data structure, and represents all or part of its display with [4mWINDOW[24m structures.  Distinct properties apply to each; for example, the [4mline[24m [4mdiscipline[0m
       of  a  typical Unix terminal driver is in one of three modes: raw, cbreak, or canonical (‚Äúcooked‚Äù).  In [4mcurses[24m, the line discipline is a property of the screen, applying identically to all windows associ‚Äê
       ated with it.

       A [4mwindow[24m is a rectangular grid of character cells, addressed by line and column coordinates ([4my[24m, [4mx[24m), with the upper left corner as (0, 0).  A window called [1mstdscr[22m, the same size as the terminal screen,  is
       always available.  Create others with [1mnewwin[22m(3NCURSES).

       A  [4mcurses[24m library does not manage overlapping windows (but see below).  You can either use [1mstdscr [22mto manage one screen-filling window, or tile the screen into non-overlapping windows and not use [1mstdscr [22mat
       all.  Mixing the two approaches will result in unpredictable and undesired effects.

       Functions permit manipulation of a window and the [4mcursor[24m identifying the cell within it at which the next operation will occur.  Among those, the most basic are [1mmove[22m(3NCURSES) and  [1maddch[22m(3NCURSES):  these
       place the cursor within and write a character to [1mstdscr[22m, respectively.

       Frequent  changes  to the terminal screen can cause unpleasant flicker or inefficient use of the communication channel to the device, so as a rule the library does not update it automatically.  Therefore,
       after using [4mcurses[24m functions to accumulate a set of desired updates that make sense to present together, call [1mrefresh[22m(3NCURSES) to tell the library to make the user's screen look like [1mstdscr[22m.  The library
       [4moptimizes[24m its output by computing a minimal volume of operations to mutate the screen from its state at the previous refresh to the new one.  Effective optimization demands accurate information about  the
       terminal device: the management of such information is the province of the [1mterminfo[22m(3NCURSES) API, a feature of every standard [4mcurses[24m implementation.

       Special windows called [4mpads[24m may also be manipulated.  These are not constrained to the size of the terminal screen and their contents need not be completely displayed.  See [1mpad[22m(3NCURSES).

       Many terminals support configuration of character cell foreground and background colors as well as [4mattributes[24m, which cause characters to render in such modes as boldfaced, underlined, or in reverse video.
       See [1mcolor[22m(3NCURSES) and [1mattr[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mcurses[24m predefines constants for a small set of forms-drawing graphics corresponding to the DEC Alternate Character Set (ACS), a feature of VT100 and other terminals.  See [1maddch[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mcurses[24m  is  implemented  using  the operating system's terminal driver; key events are received not as scan codes but as byte sequences.  The driver reports graphical keycaps (alphanumeric and punctuation
       keys, and the space) as-is.  Everything else, including the tab, enter/return, keypad, arrow, and function keys, appears to [4mcurses[24m as a control character or a multibyte [4mescape[24m [4msequence.[24m  [4mcurses[24m can trans‚Äê
       late the latter into unique [4mkey[24m [4mcodes.[24m  See [1mkeypad[22m(3NCURSES) and [1mgetch[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mncurses[24m provides reimplementations of the SVr4 [1mpanel[22m(3NCURSES), [1mform[22m(3FORM), and [1mmenu[22m(3MENU) libraries; they permit overlapping windows and ease construction of user interfaces with [4mcurses[24m.

   [1mInitialization[0m
       Beware: the terminal your program is running may or may not have the features you expect. Ncurses makes no attempt to check available features in advance. This is upon the user.

       The selection of an appropriate value of [4mTERM[24m in the process environment is essential to correct [4mcurses[24m and [4mterminfo[24m library operation.  A well-configured system selects a  correct  [4mTERM[24m  value  automati‚Äê
       cally; [1mtset[22m(1) may assist with troubleshooting exotic situations.

       If you change the terminal type, export the shell's [4mTERM[24m variable, then run [1mtset[22m(1) or the ‚Äú[1mtput init[22m‚Äù command.  See subsection ‚ÄúTabs and Initialization‚Äù of [1mterminfo[22m(5).

       If the environment variables [4mLINES[24m and [4mCOLUMNS[24m are set, or if the [4mcurses[24m program is executing in a graphical windowing environment, the information obtained thence overrides that obtained by [4mterminfo[24m.  An
       [4mncurses[24m extension supports resizable terminal displays; see [1mwresize[22m(3NCURSES).

       If  the  environment variable [4mTERMINFO[24m is defined, a [4mcurses[24m program checks first for a terminal type description in the location it identifies.  [4mTERMINFO[24m is useful for developing type descriptions or when
       write permission to [4m/usr/share/terminfo[24m is not available.

       See section ‚ÄúENVIRONMENT‚Äù below.

   [1mNaming Conventions[0m
       [4mcurses[24m offers many functions in variant forms using a regular set of alternatives to the name of an elemental one.  Those prefixed with ‚Äúw‚Äù require a [4mWINDOW[24m pointer argument;  those  with  a  ‚Äúmv‚Äù  prefix
       first perform cursor movement using [1mwmove[22m(3NCURSES); a ‚Äúmvw‚Äù prefix indicates both.  The ‚Äúw‚Äù function is typically the elemental one; the removal of this prefix usually indicates operation on [1mstdscr[22m.

       Four functions prefixed with ‚Äúp‚Äù require a [4mpad[24m argument; see below.

       In function synopses, [4mncurses[24m man pages apply the following names to parameters.  We introduce the character types in the next subsection.

                                                                                   [4mbf[24m     a [4mbool[24m ([1mTRUE [22mor [1mFALSE[22m)

                                                                                   [4mch[24m     a [4mchtype[0m
                                                                                   [4mwc[24m     a [4mwchar_t[24m or [4mwint_t[0m
                                                                                   [4mwch[24m    a [4mcchar_t[0m
                                                                                   [4mwin[24m    pointer to a [4mWINDOW[0m

                                                                                   [4mpair[24m   a foreground/background color pair identifier

   [1mWide and Non-wide Character Configurations[0m
       This man page primarily surveys functions that appear in any configuration of the library.  There are two common configurations; see section ‚ÄúALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS‚Äù below.

       [4mncurses[24m   is  the library in its ‚Äúnon-wide‚Äù configuration, handling only eight-bit characters.  It stores a character combined with attributes and a color pair identifier in a [4mchtype[24m datum, which is often
                 an alias of [4mint[24m.  A string of [4mcurses[24m characters is similar to a C [4mchar[24m string; a [4mchtype[24m string ends with an integral [1m0[22m, the null [4mcurses[24m character.

                 Attributes and a color pair identifier (with no corresponding character) can be stored in variables of [4mchtype[24m or [4mattr_t[24m type.  In either case, they are accessed via an integral bit mask.

                 Each cell of a [4mWINDOW[24m is stored as a [4mchtype[24m.  X/Open Curses does not specify the sizes of the character code or color pair identifier, nor the quantity of attribute bits, in  [4mchtype[24m;  these  are
                 implementation-dependent.  [4mncurses[24m uses eight bits for the character code.  An application requiring a wider character type, for instance to represent Unicode, should use the wide-character API.

       [4mncursesw[24m  is  the  library  in  its ‚Äúwide‚Äù configuration, which handles character encodings requiring a larger data type than [4mchar[24m (a byte-sized type) can represent.  It provides additional functions that
                 complement those in the non-wide library where the size of the underlying character type is significant.  A somewhat regular naming convention relates many of the wide variants to their non-wide
                 counterparts; where a non-wide function name contains ‚Äúch‚Äù or ‚Äústr‚Äù, prefix it with ‚Äú_w‚Äù to obtain the wide counterpart.  For example, [1mwaddch [22mbecomes [1mwadd_wch[22m.  Another  exception  is  [1mins_nwstr[0m
                 (and its variants), spelled thus instead of ‚Äúinsn_wstr‚Äù.  (Exceptions that add only ‚Äúw‚Äù comprise [1maddwstr[22m, [1minwstr[22m, and their variants.)

                 This  convention is inapplicable to some non-wide function names, so other transformations are used for the wide configuration: the window background management function ‚Äúbkgd‚Äù becomes ‚Äúbkgrnd‚Äù;
                 the window border-drawing and -clearing functions are suffixed with ‚Äú_set‚Äù; and character attribute manipulation functions like ‚Äúattron‚Äù become ‚Äúattr_on‚Äù.

                 [4mcchar_t[24m  is a [4mcurses[24m [4mcomplex[24m [4mcharacter[24m and corresponds to the non-wide configuration's [4mchtype[24m.  It is a structure type because it requires more storage than a standard  scalar  type  offers.   A
                          character  code  may  not  be  representable  as  a  [4mchar[24m, and moreover more than one character may occupy a cell (as with accent marks and other diacritics).  Each character is of type
                          [4mwchar_t[24m; a complex character contains one spacing character and zero or more non-spacing characters (see below).  A string of complex characters ends with a [4mcchar_t[24m whose [4mwchar_t[24m member
                          is the null wide character.  Attributes and a color pair identifier are stored in separate fields of the structure, not combined into an integer as in [4mchtype[24m.

                 Each cell of a [4mWINDOW[24m is stored as a [4mcchar_t[24m.  [1msetcchar[22m(3NCURSES) and [1mgetcchar[22m(3NCURSES) store and retrieve [4mcchar_t[24m data.

                 The wide library API of [4mncurses[24m depends on two data types standardized by ISO C95.

                 [4mwchar_t[24m  stores a wide character.  Like [4mchtype[24m, it may be an alias of [4mint[24m.  Depending on the character encoding, a wide character may be [4mspacing[24m, meaning that it occupies a character cell by it‚Äê
                          self and typically accompanies cursor advancement, or [4mnon-spacing[24m, meaning that it occupies the same cell as a spacing character, is often regarded as a ‚Äúmodifier‚Äù  of  the  base  glyph
                          with which it combines, and typically does not advance the cursor.

                 [4mwint_t[24m   can store a [4mwchar_t[24m or the constant [4mWEOF[24m, analogously to the [4mint[24m-sized character manipulation functions of ISO C and its constant [4mEOF[24m.

       [4mncurses[24m's [4mscreen-pointer[24m [4mextension[24m adds additional functions corresponding to many of the above, each with an ‚Äú_sp‚Äù suffix; see [1msp_funcs[22m(3NCURSES).

       The availability of some extensions is configurable when [4mncurses[24m is compiled; see sections ‚ÄúALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS‚Äù and ‚ÄúEXTENSIONS‚Äù below.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       Unless otherwise noted, functions that return integers return the constants [1mOK [22mon success and [1mERR [22mon failure; see [1mcurses_variables[22m(3NCURSES).  Functions that return pointers return [4mNULL[24m on failure.  Typi‚Äê
       cally,  [4mncurses[24m  treats a null pointer passed as a function parameter as a failure.  Functions prefixed with ‚Äúmv‚Äù first perform cursor movement and fail if the position ([4my[24m, [4mx[24m) is outside the window bound‚Äê
       aries.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       The following symbols from the process environment customize the runtime behavior of [4mncurses[24m applications.  The library may be configured to disregard the variables [4mTERMINFO[24m, [4mTERMINFO_DIRS[24m, [4mTERMPATH[24m,  and
       [4mHOME[24m, if the user is the superuser (root), or the application uses [4msetuid[24m(2) or [4msetgid[24m(2).

   [4m[1mBAUDRATE[0m
       The  debugging  library checks this variable when the application has redirected output to a file.  [4mncurses[24m interprets its integral value as the terminal's line speed in bits per second.  If that value is
       absent or invalid, [4mncurses[24m uses 9600.  This feature allows developers to construct repeatable test cases that take into account optimization decisions that depend on the terminal's line speed.

   [4m[1mCC[24m (command character)[0m
       When set, the [1mcommand_character [22m([1mcmdch[22m) capability value of loaded [4mterminfo[24m entries changes to the value of this variable.  Very few [4mterminfo[24m entries provide this feature.

       Because this name is also used in development environments to store the C compiler's name, [4mncurses[24m ignores its value if it is not one character in length.

   [4m[1mCOLUMNS[0m
       This variable specifies the width of the screen in characters.  Applications running in a windowing environment usually are able to obtain the width of the window in which they are executing.  [4mncurses[24m en‚Äê
       forces an upper limit of 512 when reading the value.  If [4mCOLUMNS[24m is not defined and the terminal's screen size is not available from the terminal driver, [4mncurses[24m uses the size  specified  by  the  [1mcolumns[0m
       ([1mcols[22m) capability of the terminal type's entry in the [4mterminfo[24m database, if any.

       It  is  important  that your application use the correct screen size.  Automatic detection thereof is not always possible because an application may be running on a host that does not honor NAWS (Negotia‚Äê
       tions About Window Size) or as a different user ID than the owner of the terminal device file.  Setting [4mCOLUMNS[24m and/or [4mLINES[24m overrides the library's use of the screen size obtained from the operating sys‚Äê
       tem.

       The [4mCOLUMNS[24m and [4mLINES[24m variables may be specified independently.  This property is useful to circumvent misfeatures of legacy terminal type descriptions; [4mxterm[24m(1) descriptions specifying 65 lines were once
       notorious.  For best results, avoid specifying [1mcols [22mand [1mlines [22mcapability codes in [4mterminfo[24m descriptions of terminal emulators.

       [1muse_env[22m(3NCURSES) can disable use of the process environment in determining the screen size.  [1muse_tioctl[22m(3NCURSES) can update [4mCOLUMNS[24m and [4mLINES[24m to match the screen size obtained from system calls  or  the
       terminal database.

   [4m[1mESCDELAY[0m
       For  [4mcurses[24m  to  distinguish the ESC character resulting from a user's press of the ‚ÄúEscape‚Äù key on the input device from one beginning an [4mescape[24m [4msequence[24m (as commonly produced by function keys), it waits
       after receiving the escape character to see if further characters are available on the input stream within a short interval.  A global variable [1mESCDELAY [22mstores this interval in milliseconds.  The  default
       value of 1000 (one second) is adequate for most uses.  This environment variable overrides it; [4mncurses[24m enforces an upper limit of 30,000 (30 seconds) when reading the value.

       The  most common instance where you may wish to change this value is to work with a remote host over a slow communication channel.  If the host running a [4mcurses[24m application does not receive the characters
       of an escape sequence in a timely manner, the library can interpret them as multiple key stroke events.

       [4mxterm[24m(1) mouse events are a form of escape sequence; therefore, if your application makes heavy use of multiple-clicking, you may wish to lengthen the default value because the delay applies to  the  com‚Äê
       posite multi-click event as well as the individual clicks.

       Portable applications should not rely upon the presence of [1mESCDELAY [22min either form, but setting the environment variable rather than the global variable does not create problems when compiling an applica‚Äê
       tion.

       If [1mkeypad[22m(3NCURSES) is disabled for the [4mcurses[24m window receiving input, a program must disambiguate escape sequences itself.

   [4m[1mHOME[0m
       [4mncurses[24m may read and write auxiliary terminal descriptions in [4m.termcap[24m and [4m.terminfo[24m files in the user's home directory.

   [4m[1mLINES[0m
       This counterpart to [4mCOLUMNS[24m specifies the height of the screen in characters.  The corresponding [4mterminfo[24m capability and code is [1mlines[22m.  See the description of the [4mCOLUMNS[24m variable above.

   [4m[1mMOUSE_BUTTONS_123[0m
       (OS/2  EMX  port only) OS/2 numbers a three-button mouse inconsistently with other platforms, such that 1 is the left button, 2 the right, and 3 the middle.  This variable customizes the mouse button num‚Äê
       bering.  Its value must be three digits 1-3 in any order.  By default, [4mncurses[24m assumes a numbering of ‚Äú132‚Äù.

   [4m[1mNCURSES_ASSUMED_COLORS[0m
       If set, this variable overrides the [4mncurses[24m library's compiled-in assumption that the terminal's default colors are white on black; see [1mdefault_colors[22m(3NCURSES).  Set the foreground and  background  color
       values with this environment variable by assigning it two integer values separated by a comma, indicating foregound and background color numbers, respectively.

       For  example,  to  tell [4mncurses[24m not to assume anything about the colors, use a value of ‚Äú-1,-1‚Äù.  To make the default color scheme green on black, use ‚Äú2,0‚Äù.  [4mncurses[24m accepts integral values from -1 up to
       the value of the [4mterminfo[24m [1mmax_colors [22m([1mcolors[22m) capability.

   [4m[1mNCURSES_CONSOLE2[0m
       (MinGW port only) The [4mConsole2[24m program defectively handles the Microsoft Console API call [4mCreateConsoleScreenBuffer[24m.  Applications that use it will hang.  However, it is possible to simulate the action of
       this call by mapping coordinates, explicitly saving and restoring the original screen contents.  Setting the environment variable [4mNCGDB[24m has the same effect.

   [4m[1mNCURSES_GPM_TERMS[0m
       (Linux only) When [4mncurses[24m is configured to use the GPM interface, this variable may list one or more terminal type names, delimited by vertical bars ([1m|[22m) or colons ([1m:[22m), against which the [4mTERM[24m variable (see
       below) is matched.  An empty value disables the GPM interface, using [4mncurses[24m's built-in support for [4mxterm[24m(1) mouse protocols instead.  If the variable is absent, [4mncurses[24m attempts to open GPM if [4mTERM[24m  con‚Äê
       tains ‚Äúlinux‚Äù.

   [4m[1mNCURSES_NO_HARD_TABS[0m
       [4mncurses[24m  may use tab characters in cursor movement optimization.  In some cases, your terminal driver may not handle them properly.  Set this environment variable to any value to disable the feature.  You
       can also adjust your [4mstty[24m(1) settings to avoid the problem.

   [4m[1mNCURSES_NO_MAGIC_COOKIE[0m
       Many terminals store video attributes as a property of a character cell, as [4mcurses[24m does.  Historically, some recorded changes in video attributes as data that logically [4moccupies[24m  character  cells  on  the
       display,  switching attributes on or off, similarly to tags in a markup language; these are termed ‚Äúmagic cookies‚Äù, and must be subsequently overprinted.  If the [4mterminfo[24m entry for your terminal type does
       not adequately describe its handling of magic cookies, set this variable to any value to instruct [4mncurses[24m to disable attributes entirely.

   [4m[1mNCURSES_NO_PADDING[0m
       Most terminal type descriptions in the [4mterminfo[24m database detail hardware devices.  Many people use [4mcurses[24m-based applications in terminal emulator programs that run in a windowing environment.  These  pro‚Äê
       grams  can  duplicate  all of the important features of a hardware terminal, but often lack their limitations.  Chief among these absent drawbacks is the problem of data flow management; that is, limiting
       the speed of communication to what the hardware could handle.  Unless a hardware terminal is interfaced into a terminal concentrator (which does flow control), an application must manage  flow  itself  to
       prevent overruns and data loss.

       A  solution  that comes at no hardware cost is for an application to pause after directing a terminal to execute an operation that it performs slowly, such as clearing the display.  Many terminal type de‚Äê
       scriptions, including that for the VT100, embed delay specifications in capabilities.  You may wish to use these terminal descriptions without paying the performance penalty.   Set  [4mNCURSES_NO_PADDING[24m  to
       any value to disable all but mandatory padding.  Mandatory padding is used by such terminal capabilities as [1mflash_screen [22m([1mflash[22m).

   [4m[1mNCURSES_NO_SETBUF[0m
       (Obsolete)  Prior  to  internal  changes  developed in [4mncurses[24m 5.9 (patches 20120825 through 20130126), the library used [4msetbuf[24m(3) to enable fully buffered output when initializing the terminal.  This was
       done, as in SVr4 [4mcurses[24m, to increase performance.  For testing purposes, both of [4mncurses[24m and of certain applications, this feature was made optional.  Setting  this  variable  disabled  output  buffering,
       leaving the output stream in the original (usually line-buffered) mode.

       Nowadays,  [4mncurses[24m performs its own buffering and does not require this workaround; it does not modify the buffering of the standard output stream.  This approach makes signal handling, as for interrupts,
       more robust.  A drawback is that certain unconventional programs mixed [4mstdio[24m(3) calls with [4mncurses[24m calls and (usually) got the behavior they expected.  This is no longer the case; [4mncurses[24m does  not  write
       to the standard output file descriptor through a [4mstdio[24m-buffered stream.

       As a special case, low-level API calls such as [1mputp[22m(3NCURSES) still use the standard output stream.  High-level [4mcurses[24m calls such as [1mprintw[22m(3NCURSES) do not.

   [4m[1mNCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS[0m
       At  initialization, [4mncurses[24m inspects the [4mTERM[24m environment variable for special cases where VT100 forms-drawing characters (and the corresponding alternate character set [4mterminfo[24m capabilities) are known to
       be unsupported by terminal types that otherwise claim VT100 compatibility.  Specifically, when running in a UTF-8 locale, the Linux virtual console device and the GNU [4mscreen[24m(1) program ignore  them.   Set
       this  variable  to  a  nonzero value to instruct [4mncurses[24m that the terminal's ACS support is broken; the library then outputs Unicode code points that correspond to the forms-drawing characters.  Set it to
       zero (or a non-integer) to disable the special check for terminal type names matching ‚Äúlinux‚Äù or ‚Äúscreen‚Äù, directing [4mncurses[24m to assume that the ACS feature works if the terminal  type  description  adver‚Äê
       tises it.

       As an alternative to use of this variable, [4mncurses[24m checks for an extended [4mterminfo[24m numeric capability [1mU8 [22mthat can be compiled using ‚Äú[1mtic -x[22m‚Äù.  Examples follow.

          # linux console, if patched to provide working
          # VT100 shift-in/shift-out, with corresponding font.
          linux-vt100|linux console with VT100 line-graphics,
                  U8#0, use=linux,

          # uxterm with vt100Graphics resource set to false
          xterm-utf8|xterm relying on UTF-8 line-graphics,
                  U8#1, use=xterm,

       The two-character name ‚ÄúU8‚Äù was chosen to permit its use via [4mncurses[24m's [4mtermcap[24m interface.

   [4m[1mNCURSES_TRACE[0m
       At  initialization,  [4mncurses[24m (in its debugging configuration) checks for this variable's presence.  If defined with an integral value, the library calls [1mcurses_trace[22m(3NCURSES) with that value as the argu‚Äê
       ment.

   [4m[1mTERM[0m
       The [4mTERM[24m variable denotes the terminal type.  Each is distinct, though many are similar.  It is commonly set by terminal emulators to help applications find a workable terminal description.  Some choose a
       popular approximation such as ‚Äúansi‚Äù, ‚Äúvt100‚Äù, or ‚Äúxterm‚Äù rather than an exact fit to their capabilities.  Not infrequently, an application will have problems with that approach; for example, a key stroke
       may not operate correctly, or produce no effect but seeming garbage characters on the screen.

       Setting [4mTERM[24m has no effect on hardware operation; it affects the way applications communicate with the terminal.  Likewise, as a general rule ([4mxterm[24m(1) being a rare exception), terminal emulators that al‚Äê
       low you to specify [4mTERM[24m as a parameter or configuration value do not change their behavior to match that setting.

   [4m[1mTERMCAP[0m
       If [4mncurses[24m is configured with [4mtermcap[24m support, it checks for a terminal type description in [4mtermcap[24m format if one in [4mterminfo[24m format is not available.  Setting this variable directs [4mncurses[24m to ignore  the
       usual  [4mtermcap[24m  database location, [4m/etc/termcap[24m; see [4mTERMPATH[24m below.  [4mTERMCAP[24m should contain either a terminal description (with newlines stripped out), or a file name indicating where the information re‚Äê
       quired by the [4mTERM[24m environment variable is stored.

   [4m[1mTERMINFO[0m
       [4mncurses[24m can be configured to read terminal type description databases in various locations using different formats.  This variable overrides the default location.

       ‚Ä¢   Descriptions in [4mterminfo[24m format are normally stored in a directory tree using subdirectories named for the common first letters of the terminal types named therein.  This is the scheme  used  in  Sys‚Äê
           tem V.

       ‚Ä¢   If [4mncurses[24m is configured to use hashed databases, then [4mTERMINFO[24m may name its location, such as [4m/usr/share/terminfo.db[24m, rather than [4m/usr/share/terminfo/[24m.

       The  hashed database uses less disk space and is a little faster than the directory tree.  However, some applications assume the existence of the directory tree, and read it directly rather than using the
       [4mterminfo[24m API.

       ‚Ä¢   If [4mncurses[24m is configured with [4mtermcap[24m support, this variable may contain the location of a [4mtermcap[24m file.

       ‚Ä¢   If the value of [4mTERMINFO[24m begins with ‚Äúhex:‚Äù or ‚Äúb64:‚Äù, [4mncurses[24m uses the remainder of the value as a compiled [4mterminfo[24m description.  You might produce the base64 format using [1minfocmp[22m(1).

                  TERMINFO=$(infocmp -0 -Q2 -q)
                  export TERMINFO

           The compiled description is used only if it corresponds to the terminal type identified by [4mTERM[24m.

       Setting [4mTERMINFO[24m is the simplest, but not the only, way to direct [4mncurses[24m to a terminal database.  The search path is as follows.

       ‚Ä¢   the last terminal database to which the running [4mncurses[24m application wrote, if any

       ‚Ä¢   the location specified by the [4mTERMINFO[24m environment variable

       ‚Ä¢   [4m$HOME/.terminfo[0m

       ‚Ä¢   locations listed in the [4mTERMINFO_DIRS[24m environment variable

       ‚Ä¢   location(s) configured and compiled into [4mncurses[0m

           ‚Ä¢   [4m/etc/terminfo:/usr/share/terminfo[0m

           ‚Ä¢   [4m/usr/share/terminfo[0m

   [4m[1mTERMINFO_DIRS[0m
       This variable specifies a list of locations, akin to [4mPATH[24m, in which [4mncurses[24m searches for the terminal type descriptions described by [4mTERMINFO[24m above.  The list items are separated by  colons  on  Unix  and
       semicolons on OS/2 EMX.  System V [4mterminfo[24m lacks a corresponding feature; [4mTERMINFO_DIRS[24m is an [4mncurses[24m extension.

   [4m[1mTERMPATH[0m
       If  [4mTERMCAP[24m does not hold a terminal type description or file name, then [4mncurses[24m checks the contents of [4mTERMPATH[24m, a list of locations, akin to [4mPATH[24m, in which it searches for [4mtermcap[24m terminal type descrip‚Äê
       tions.  The list items are separated by colons on Unix and semicolons on OS/2 EMX.

       If both [4mTERMCAP[24m and [4mTERMPATH[24m are unset or invalid, [4mncurses[24m searches for the files [4m/etc/termcap[24m, [4m/usr/share/misc/termcap[24m, and [4m$HOME/.termcap[24m, in that order.

[1mALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS[0m
       Many different [4mncurses[24m configurations are possible, determined by the options given to the [4mconfigure[24m script when building the library.  Run the script with the [1m--help [22moption to peruse them all.  A few are
       of particular significance to the application developer employing [4mncurses[24m.

       [1m--disable-overwrite[0m
            The standard C preprocessor inclusion for the [4mcurses[24m library is as follows.

                [1m#include <curses.h>[0m

            This option is used to avoid file name conflicts between [4mncurses[24m and an existing [4mcurses[24m installation on the system.  If [4mncurses[24m is installed disabling overwrite, it puts its header files in a  subdi‚Äê
            rectory.  Here is an example.

                [1m#include <ncurses/curses.h>[0m

            Installation also omits a symbolic link that would cause the compiler's [1m-lcurses [22moption to link object files with [4mncurses[24m instead of the system [4mcurses[24m library.

            The directory used by this configuration of [4mncurses[24m is shown in section ‚ÄúSYNOPSIS‚Äù above.

       [1m--enable-widec[0m
            The  configure  script  renames  the  library and (if the [1m--disable-overwrite [22moption is used) puts the header files in a different subdirectory.  All of the library names have a ‚Äúw‚Äù appended to them,
            i.e., instead of

                [1m-lncurses[0m

            you link with

                [1m-lncursesw[0m

            You must also enable the wide-character features in the header file when compiling for the wide-character library to use the extended (wide-character) functions.  The symbol which enables these  fea‚Äê
            tures has changed since X/Open Curses Issue 4:

            ‚Ä¢   Originally, the wide-character feature required the symbol [1m_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED [22mbut that was only valid for XPG4 (1996).

            ‚Ä¢   Later, that was deemed conflicting with [1m_XOPEN_SOURCE [22mdefined to 500.

            ‚Ä¢   As of mid-2018, none of the features in this implementation require a [1m_XOPEN_SOURCE [22mfeature greater than 600.  However, X/Open Curses Issue 7 (2009) recommends defining it to 700.

            ‚Ä¢   Alternatively,  you  can enable the feature by defining [1mNCURSES_WIDECHAR [22mwith the caveat that some other header file than [1mcurses.h [22mmay require a specific value for [1m_XOPEN_SOURCE [22m(or a system-spe‚Äê
                cific symbol).

            The [4mcurses.h[24m header file installed for the wide-character library is designed to be compatible with the non-wide library's header.  Only the size of the [4mWINDOW[24m structure differs; few applications re‚Äê
            quire more than pointers to [4mWINDOW[24ms.

            If the headers are installed allowing overwrite, the wide-character library's headers should be installed last, to allow applications to be built using either library from the same set of headers.

       [1m--with-pthread[0m
            The configure script renames the library.  All of the library names have a ‚Äút‚Äù appended to them (before any ‚Äúw‚Äù added by [1m--enable-widec[22m).

            The global variables such as [1mLINES [22mare replaced by macros to allow read-only access.  At the same time, setter-functions are provided to set these values.  Some applications (very  few)  may  require
            changes to work with this convention.

       [1m--with-shared[0m
       [1m--with-normal[0m
       [1m--with-debug[0m
       [1m--with-profile[0m
            The  shared  and normal (static) library names differ by their suffixes, e.g., [1mlibncurses.so [22mand [1mlibncurses.a[22m.  The debug and profiling libraries add a ‚Äú_g‚Äù and a ‚Äú_p‚Äù to the root names respectively,
            e.g., [1mlibncurses_g.a [22mand [1mlibncurses_p.a[22m.

       [1m--with-termlib[0m
            Low-level functions which do not depend upon whether the library supports wide-characters, are provided in the tinfo library.

            By doing this, it is possible to share the tinfo library between wide/normal configurations as well as reduce the size of the library when only low-level functions are needed.

            Those functions are described in these pages:

[1mNOTES[0m
       X/Open Curses permits most functions it specifies to be made available as macros as well.  [4mncurses[24m does so

       ‚Ä¢   for functions that return values via their parameters,

       ‚Ä¢   to support obsolete features,

       ‚Ä¢   to reuse functions (for example, those that move the cursor before another operation), and

       ‚Ä¢   in a few special cases.

       If the standard output file descriptor of an [4mncurses[24m program is redirected to something that is not a terminal device, the library writes screen updates to the standard error file descriptor.  This was an
       undocumented feature of SVr3 [4mcurses[24m.

       See subsection ‚ÄúHeader Files‚Äù below regarding symbols exposed by inclusion of [4mcurses.h[24m.

[1mEXTENSIONS[0m
       [4mncurses[24m enables an application to capture mouse events on certain terminals, including [4mxterm[24m(1); see [1mmouse[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mncurses[24m provides a means of responding to window resizing events, as when running in a GUI terminal emulator application such as [4mxterm[24m; see [1mresizeterm[22m(3NCURSES) and [1mwresize[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mncurses[24m allows an application to query the terminal for the presence of a wide variety of special keys; see [1mhas_key[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mncurses[24m  extends  the  fixed  set  of  function  key  capabilities  specified  by X/Open Curses by allowing the application programmer to define additional key events at runtime; see [1mdefine_key[22m(3NCURSES),
       [1mkey_defined[22m(3NCURSES), [1mkeybound[22m(3NCURSES), and [1mkeyok[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mncurses[24m can exploit the capabilities of terminals implementing ISO 6429/ECMA-48 SGR 39 and SGR 49 sequences, which allow an application to reset the terminal to its original foreground and background col‚Äê
       ors.  From a  user's  perspective,  the  application  is  able  to  draw  colored  text  on  a  background  whose  color  is  set  independently,  providing  better  control  over  color  contrasts.   See
       [1mdefault_colors[22m(3NCURSES).

       An [4mncurses[24m application can eschew knowledge of [4mSCREEN[24m and [4mWINDOW[24m structure internals, instead using accessor functions such as [1mis_cbreak[22m(3NCURSES) and [1mis_scrollok[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mncurses[24m enables an application to direct its output to a printer attached to the terminal device; see [1mprint[22m(3NCURSES).

       [4mncurses[24m  offers [1mslk_attr[22m(3NCURSES) as a counterpart of [1mattr_get[22m(3NCURSES) for soft-label key lines, and [1mextended_slk_color[22m(3NCURSES) as a form of [1mslk_color[22m(3NCURSES) that can gather color information from
       them when many colors are supported.

       [4mncurses[24m permits modification of [1munctrl[22m(3NCURSES)'s behavior; see [1muse_legacy_coding[22m(3NCURSES).

       Rudimentary support for multi-threaded applications may be available; see [1mthreads[22m(3NCURSES).

       Functions that ease the management of multiple screens can be exposed; see [1msp_funcs[22m(3NCURSES).

       To aid applications to debug their memory usage, [4mncurses[24m optionally offers functions to more aggressively free memory it dynamically allocates itself; see [1mmemleaks[22m(3NCURSES).

       The library facilitates auditing and troubleshooting of its behavior; see [1mtrace[22m(3NCURSES).

       Compiling [4mncurses[24m with the option [1m-DUSE_GETCAP [22mcauses it to fall back to reading [4m/etc/termcap[24m if the terminal setup code cannot find a [4mterminfo[24m entry corresponding to [4mTERM[24m.  Use of  this  feature  is  not
       recommended, as it essentially includes an entire [4mtermcap[24m compiler in the [4mncurses[24m startup code, at a cost in memory usage and application launch latency.

       [4mPDCurses[24m and NetBSD [4mcurses[24m incorporate some [4mncurses[24m extensions.  Individual man pages indicate where this is the case.

[1mPORTABILITY[0m
       X/Open  Curses defines two levels of conformance, ‚Äúbase‚Äù and ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù.  The latter includes several additional features, such as wide-character and color support.  [4mncurses[24m intends base-level conformance
       with X/Open Curses, and supports all features of its enhanced level except the [4muntic[24m utility.

       Differences between X/Open Curses and [4mncurses[24m are documented in the ‚ÄúPORTABILITY‚Äù sections of applicable man pages.

   [1mError Checking[0m
       In many cases, X/Open Curses is vague about error conditions, omitting some of the SVr4 documentation.

       Unlike other implementations, [4mncurses[24m checks pointer parameters, such as those to [4mWINDOW[24m structures, to ensure that they are not null.  This is done primarily to guard against programmer error.  The stan‚Äê
       dard interface does not provide a way for the library to tell an application which of several possible errors occurred.  An application that relies on [4mncurses[24m to check its function parameters for validity
       limits its portability and robustness.

   [1mPadding Differences[0m
       In historical [4mcurses[24m implementations, delays embedded in the [4mterminfo[24m capabilities [1mcarriage_return [22m([1mcr[22m), [1mscroll_forward [22m([1mind[22m), [1mcursor_left [22m([1mcub1[22m), [1mform_feed [22m([1mff[22m), and [1mtab [22m([1mht[22m) activated corresponding  de‚Äê
       lay  bits in the Unix terminal driver.  [4mncurses[24m performs all padding by sending NUL bytes to the device.  This method is slightly more expensive, but narrows the interface to the Unix kernel significantly
       and correspondingly increases the package's portability.

   [1mHeader Files[0m
       The header file [4mcurses.h[24m itself includes the header files [4mstdio.h[24m and [4munctrl.h[24m.

       X/Open Curses has more to say,

           The inclusion of [4mcurses.h[24m may make visible all symbols from the headers [4mstdio.h[24m, [4mterm.h[24m, [4mtermios.h[24m, and [4mwchar.h[24m.

       but does not finish the story.  A more complete account follows.

       ‚Ä¢   The first [4mcurses[24m, in 4BSD, provided a [4mcurses.h[24m file.

           BSD [4mcurses[24m code included [4mcurses.h[24m and [4munctrl.h[24m from an internal header file [4mcurses.ext[24m, where ‚Äúext‚Äù abbreviated ‚Äúexterns‚Äù.

           The implementations of [4mprintw[24m and [4mscanw[24m used undocumented internal functions of the standard I/O library ([4m_doprnt[24m and [4m_doscan[24m), but nothing in [4mcurses.h[24m itself relied upon [4mstdio.h[24m.

       ‚Ä¢   SVr2 [4mcurses[24m added [4mnewterm[24m, which relies upon [4mstdio.h[24m because its function prototype employs the [4mFILE[24m type.

           SVr4 [4mcurses[24m added [4mputwin[24m and [4mgetwin[24m, which also use [4mstdio.h[24m.

           X/Open Curses specifies all three of these functions.

           SVr4 [4mcurses[24m and X/Open Curses do not require the developer to include [4mstdio.h[24m before [4mcurses.h[24m.  Both document use of [4mcurses[24m as requiring only [4mcurses.h[24m.

           As a result, standard [4mcurses.h[24m always includes [4mstdio.h[24m.

       ‚Ä¢   X/Open Curses and SVr4 [4mcurses[24m are inconsistent with respect to [4munctrl.h[24m.

           As noted in [1mutil[22m(3NCURSES), [4mncurses[24m includes [4munctrl.h[24m from [4mcurses.h[24m (as SVr4 does).

       ‚Ä¢   X/Open Curses's comments about [4mterm.h[24m and [4mtermios.h[24m may refer to HP-UX and AIX.

           HP-UX [4mcurses[24m includes [4mterm.h[24m from [4mcurses.h[24m to declare [4msetupterm[24m in [4mcurses.h[24m, but [4mncurses[24m and Solaris [4mcurses[24m do not.

           AIX [4mcurses[24m includes [4mterm.h[24m and [4mtermios.h[24m.  Again, [4mncurses[24m and Solaris [4mcurses[24m do not.

       ‚Ä¢   X/Open Curses says that [4mcurses.h[24m [1mmay [22minclude [4mterm.h[24m, but does not require it to do so.

           Some programs use functions declared in both [4mcurses.h[24m and [4mterm.h[24m, and must include both header files in the same module.  Very old versions of AIX [4mcurses[24m required inclusion of [4mcurses.h[24m before [4mterm.h[24m.

           The header files supplied by [4mncurses[24m include the standard library headers required for its declarations, so [4mncurses[24m's own header files can be included in any order.  For portability even  to  old  AIX
           systems, include [4mcurses.h[24m before [4mterm.h[24m.

       ‚Ä¢   X/Open Curses says ‚Äúmay make visible‚Äù because including a header file does not necessarily make visible all of the symbols in it (consider [1m#ifdef [22mand similar).

           For  instance, [4mncurses[24m's [4mcurses.h[24m [1mmay [22minclude [4mwchar.h[24m if the proper symbol is defined, and if [4mncurses[24m is configured for wide-character support.  If [4mwchar.h[24m is included, its symbols [1mmay [22mbe made visible
           depending on the value of the [1m_XOPEN_SOURCE [22mfeature test macro.

       ‚Ä¢   X/Open Curses mandates an application's inclusion of one standard C library header in a special case: [4mstdarg.h[24m before [4mcurses.h[24m to prototype the functions [4mvw_printw[24m and [4mvw_scanw[24m (as well as  the  obso‚Äê
           lete [4mvwprintw[24m and [4mvwscanw[24m).  Each of these takes a variadic argument list, a [4mva_list[24m parameter, like that of [4mprintf[24m(3).

           SVr3  [4mcurses[24m  introduced the two obsolete functions, and X/Open Curses the others.  In between, SVr4 [4mcurses[24m provided for the possibility that an application might include either [4mvarargs.h[24m or [4mstdarg.h[24m.
           These represented contrasting approaches to handling variadic argument lists.  The older interface, [4mvarargs.h[24m, used a pointer to [4mchar[24m for variadic functions' [4mva_list[24m parameter.  Later,  the  list  ac‚Äê
           quired its own standard data type, [4mva_list[24m, defined in [4mstdarg.h[24m, empowering the compiler to check the types of a function call's actual parameters against the formal ones declared in its prototype.

           No  conforming  implementations of X/Open Curses require an application to include [4mstdarg.h[24m before [4mcurses.h[24m because they either have allowed for a special type, or, like [4mncurses[24m, they include [4mstdarg.h[0m
           themselves to provide a portable interface.
